        <p> Wildlife experts on the French island of Corsica have discovered an unusual “cat-fox,” which may be a new species. Wildlife experts on the French island of Corsica have discovered an unusual “cat-fox,” which may be a new species.

          AFP reports that a number of the felines have been captured in the northern part of the Mediterranean island by officials from France’s National Hunting and Wildlife Office (ONCFS).
          
          Known as “chat-renard” (cat-fox) in French and “Ghjattu volpe” in the Corsican language, the animals have long been part of local legend. Not surprisingly, the felines are generating plenty of buzz.
          
          Wildlife rangers showed AFP a “cat-fox” that had been captured in Corsica’s Asco Forest. Measuring about 35 inches from head to tail, the animal has “very wide” ears, “highly developed” canines and short whiskers, according to officials. The animal also has a thick coat, stripes on its front legs and dark hind legs.</p>

          Earlier this year, a hiker in Southern California thought he had found an abandoned puppy in a canyon. The cute animal, however, was not all that it seemed. When wildlife officers examined the creature, they realized that it was a coyote pup.</p>

After the felines are studied, they are released.
